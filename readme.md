# Hawkeye

## What is Hawkeye?
Hawkeye is a reference citation creation and management tool. I intend to only support the Modern Language Association 8th Edition (MLA8) standards for now.

## How do I run it?
This project is written in TypeScript which compiles in a Node.js environment to JS. Make sure to install the `typescript` and `ts-node` packages to allow the project to run and then install all the packages specified in the `package.json`. Here are the commands you'll need:
```shell
$ npm install -g typscript
$ npm install -g ts-node
$ npm i
$ ts-node src
```
Then navigate to http://localhost:2000/.

## What are my sources the standards?
Purdue University's Online Writing Lab (OWL) [MLA Style Guide](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_style_introduction.html)

## What the hell is this name?
The name is a reference to personal adjudant and bodyguard to Colonel Roy Mustang, Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye in the *Fullmetal Alchemist* (鋼の錬金術師, Hagane no Renkinjutsushi) manga and anime series. I picked her name because of her irreplecable role as a secretary for Mustang in the series.

## Possible Future Plans
- APA support
- Chicago support
- Harvard support
