# Hawkeye

## What is Hawkwye?
Hawkeye is a reference citation creation and management tool. I intend to only support the Modern Language Association 8th Edition standards for now.

## What are my sources the standards?
Purdue University's Online Writing Lab (OWL) [MLA Style Guide](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_style_introduction.html)

## What the hell is this name?
The name is a reference to personal ajudant and bodyguard to Colonel Roy Mustang, Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye in the *Fullmetal Alchemist* (鋼の錬金術師, Hagane no Renkinjutsushi) manga and anime series. I picked her name because of her irreplecable role as a secretary for Mustang in the series.

## Possible Future Plans
- APA support
- Chicago support
- Harvard support
